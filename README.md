# 100daysofRTL
Welcome to my #100daysofRTL In this repo, I'll be documenting my daily progress as I delve into the world of RTL design.ðŸ™Œ

Becoming a successful RTL designer involves taking systematic steps, and I've outlined a structured approach in my #100daysofRTL journey. 
Over the course of 100 days, my goal is to create, code, and validate various logic designs using Hardware Description Language (HDL) 
while employing High-Level Verification (HVL) techniques. With determination and perseverance, I aim to make the most of this journey and emerge as a proficient RTL engineer. 
Let's keep moving forward and strive for excellence!ðŸ¤“
